# React Workflow Builder

This project is a simple drag-and-drop workflow builder built with React and React Flow.  
It allows users to design workflows by placing different types of nodes on a canvas and connecting them.

## Features

- Drag and drop nodes from a palette onto the canvas
- Connect nodes with edges to build flows
- Edit node labels and properties
- Save and load workflow state (local storage / mock API)
- Auto-layout in both vertical (top-to-bottom) and horizontal (left-to-right) directions
- Responsive design (properties panel hides on smaller screens)
